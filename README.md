## 👋 Hi, I'm Alex🌾
I am a Risk Management and Business Intelligence graduate and work as a software developer. Having two-years experience of data mining and analytics, I have developed my Python skills in Natural Language Processing and building regression model. I had been interning for web development, using Angular and Bootstrap, to build websites for performing CRUD actions on employees' data. I further consolidated my foundation on web development by working on self projects using React and by building backend server using MongoDB, axios, Node.js and Express.js. I am currently learning object-oriented design using Java.
