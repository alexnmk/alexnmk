## 👋 Hi, I'm Alex🌾
I am a Business Intelligence graduate and work as a software developer. <br/><br/>Regarding data mining and analytics, I have developed my Python skills in Natural Language Processing and building regression model. <br/><br/>I had been interning for web development, using Angular and Bootstrap, to build websites for performing CRUD actions on employees' data. I further consolidated my foundation on web development by working on self projects using React and by building backend server using MongoDB, axios, Node.js and Express.js. <br/><br/>I am currently learning object-oriented design using Java.
